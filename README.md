# Data Analysis on Uber Dataset :
Data is of high-value in todayâ€™s rapidly growing environment. I am always interested in learning about new technologies in this ever-changing field of computing. 
Over the weekend, I participated in a Hackathon conducted by Innomatics Research Labs. 
Through this hackathon, I could leverage my learnings, which gave me an opportunity to explore the practical applications of Data Analysis and Machine learning field.

The idea was to do 'Data Analysis and apply Machine Learning algorithm on Uber Dataset'. The Analysis was done with the help of Python and I used various modules such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and sklearn.

Introduction of Uber :
Uber is a ride-hailing company that relies heavily on data science and analysis to support its day-to-day operations and provide hassle-free rides and deliveries to customers. 
Data science is a critical component of Uber's operations, and the company invests heavily in its data science and technology capabilities. 
Some of the key use cases of data science in Uber include - dynamic pricing, driver assignment, safety, fraud, customer experience, etc. 
In this process, we will extensively explore a dataset of Uber rides.

In the Hackathon, we were given multiple tasks to do:

Task 1: To do Data Analysis on "Uber Rides" dataset

Task 2: To calculate Haversine distance between each pickup and dropoff location

Task 3: To Apply a Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the fare amount given following input features:
passenger_count, distance and ride_week_day.
ML algorithms to apply and find the least adjusted R square value?
* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Regression
* KNN Classifier

I was fascinated by the fact that we can transform data into critical fragments of information and get insights to make informed meaningful decisions. 
It has been an enriching experience that has helped me sharpen my knowledge.
