# Data Analysis and applying ML algorithms on "Uber Rides" Dataset :
Recently, I participated in a 4-hour Live Hackathon conducted by Innomatics Research Labs. It was an amazing experience being able to take part in such a wonderfully planned virtual coding event, and I learned so much during the entire process about Data Analysis and Machine learning.

The idea was to do 'Data Analysis and apply Machine Learning algorithm on Uber Dataset'. It was done with the help of Python and I used various libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and sklearn.

Introduction of Uber :
Uber is a ride-hailing company that relies heavily on data science and analysis to support its day-to-day operations and provide hassle-free rides and deliveries to customers. Data science is a critical component of Uber's operations, and the company invests heavily in its data science and technology capabilities. It was fascinating to know some of the key use cases of data science in Uber are dynamic pricing, driver assignment, safety, fraud, customer experience, etc. In this process, we extensively explored a dataset of Uber rides.

In this Hackathon, we were given multiple tasks to do:

Task 1: To do Data Analysis on "Uber Rides" dataset

Task 2: To calculate Haversine distance between each pickup and dropoff location

Task 3: To Apply a Machine Learning Algorithm and predict the fare amount using the following input features: passenger_count, distance and ride_week_day. 
ML algorithms to apply and find the least adjusted R square value :
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Regression
- KNN Classifier
 
It has been an enthralling experience that has helped me continue to expand my knowledge.
